Visualization page for most recent week of USGS Earthquakes

This repository presents a web page (index.html) that will display a map showing the latest earthquakes detected by the United States Geoligical Survey. It pulls the most recent week of data from the USGS earthquake feed, plots all events on a world map, and provides data on location, magnitude, and depth of the earthquake. The size of the markers for all events is determined by the magnitude of the earthquake, and the color of the marker is determined by the depth with green earthquakes representing shallow events, and red earthquakes representing deep events.
